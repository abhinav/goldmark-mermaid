## v0.5.0 - 2023-11-03

This release brings support for rendering diagrams server-side
without the need for the MermaidJS CLI.

You can use this functionality by installing a `mermaidcdp.Compiler`
into your `mermaid.Extender` or `mermaid.ServerRenderer`.
For example:

```go
import "go.abhg.dev/goldmark/mermaid/mermaidcdp"

compiler, err := mermaidcdp.New(&mermaidcdp.Config{
  JSSource: mermaidJSSource, // contents of mermaid.min.js
})
if err != nil {
  return err
}
defer compiler.Close()

md := goldmark.New(
  goldmark.WithExtensions(
    // ...
    &mermaid.Extender{
      Compiler: compiler,
    },
  ),
  // ...
)
```

Use of mermaidcdp is highly recommended for server-side rendering
if you have lots of diagrams or documents to render.
This should be substantially faster than invoking the `mmdc` CLI.

### Breaking changes
- ServerRenderer: Delete `MMDC` and `Theme` fields.
  If you need these, you can provide them with the `CLICompiler` instead.
- `CLI` and `MMDC` were flipped.
  The old `MMDC` interface is now named `CLI`, and it now accepts a context.
  You can use the new `MMDC` function to build an instance of it.
- ClientRenderer, Extender: Rename `MermaidJS` to `MermaidURL`.
- Rename `DefaultMMDC` to `DefaultCLI`.
- Extender: Replace `MMDC` field with the `CLI` field.

### Added
- ServerRenderer now supports pluggable `Compiler`s.
- Add `CLICompiler` to render diagrams by invoking MermaidJS CLI. Plugs into ServerRenderer.
- Add mermaidcdp subpackage to render diagrams with a long-running Chromium-based process.
  Plugs into ServerRenderer.
