## v0.2.0 - 2022-11-04
### Added
- ServerRenderer with support for rendering Mermaid diagrams
  into inline SVGs server-side.
  This is picked automatically if an 'mmdc' executable is found on PATH.
- Support opting out of the MermaidJS `<script>` tag.
  To use, set `Extender.NoScript` or `Transformer.NoScript` to true.
  Use this if the page you're rendering into already includes the tag
  elsewhere.

### Changed
- Deprecate Renderer in favor of ClientRenderer.
  Rendere has been aliased to the new type
  so existing code should continue to work unchanged.
