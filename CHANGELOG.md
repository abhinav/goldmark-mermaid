## v0.4.0 - 2023-03-24
### Changed
- ClientRenderer: Use `<pre>` instead of `<div>` for diagram containers.

### Added
- Support changing the container tag with the `ContainerTag` option.
  This option is available on ClientRenderer, ServerRenderer, and Extender.

## v0.3.0 - 2022-12-19
### Changed
- Change the module path to `go.abhg.dev/goldmark/mermaid`.

### Removed
- Delete previously deprecated Renderer type.
  Please use the ClientRenderer instead.

## v0.2.0 - 2022-11-04
### Added
- ServerRenderer with support for rendering Mermaid diagrams
  into inline SVGs server-side.
  This is picked automatically if an 'mmdc' executable is found on PATH.
- Support opting out of the MermaidJS `<script>` tag.
  To use, set `Extender.NoScript` or `Transformer.NoScript` to true.
  Use this if the page you're rendering into already includes the tag
  elsewhere.

### Changed
- Deprecate Renderer in favor of ClientRenderer.
  Rendere has been aliased to the new type
  so existing code should continue to work unchanged.

## v0.1.1 - 2021-11-03
### Fixed

- Fix handling of multiple mermaid blocks.

## v0.1.0 - 2021-04-12
