= Rendering Mermaid diagrams with Chrome DevTools Protocol

:toc: preamble
:source-language: go

Abstract::
  This documents a design for adding support to goldmark-mermaid
  for rendering Mermaid diagrams server-side
  using the Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP).
Issue::
  https://github.com/abhinav/goldmark-mermaid/issues/28[#28]

== Background

goldmark-mermaid supports two forms of rendering:
client-side and server-side.
Server-side rendering is implemented by
shelling out to the Mermaid CLI (`mmdc`).

It is possible to implement this functionality without the Mermaid CLI
with use of the Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP).
CDP expects Chrome, Chromium, or another compatible browser on the system.
It spawns a headless version of the browser, and drives it with an RPC API.

`mmdc` relies on Puppeteer, which uses similar technology.
So if `mmdc` works on a system, so will CDP.

=== Existing API

goldmark-mermaid currently offers the following APIs
with regards to server-side rendering.

----
// MMDC builds an exec.Cmd that will run
// the Mermaid CLI with the provided arguments.
type MMDC struct {
  Command(...string) *exec.Cmd
}

type CLI struct{ /* .. */ }

var _ MMDC = (*CLI)(nil)

// ServerRenderer renders Goldmark diagrams server-side,
// replacing them with SVGs in the final output.
//
// It is a goldmark.NodeRenderer.
type ServerRenderer struct {
  MMDC  MMDC
  Theme string
  // ...
}

// Extender extends a goldmark.Markdown,
// installing the ServerRenderer if appropriate.
type Extender struct {
  RenderMode RenderMode
  MMDC       MMDC
  Theme      Theme
  // ...
}

type RenderMode int

const (
  // RenderModeServer indicates that we're rendering diagrams
  // server-side.
  RenderModeServer RenderMode = // ...
  // ...
)
----

=== MermaidJS API

To use CDP to render Mermaid diagrams,
we'll be delegating the rendering to a JavaScript interpreter
running inside the headless Chrome process.

The following bits of the MermaidJS API are relevant:

[,typescript]
----
mermaid.initialize({
  startOnLoad: bool, // we want this to be false
  theme: string,
})

mermaid.render(
  name: string,
  src: string,
): Promise<{svg: string}>
----

> **NOTE**: Theme is specified once at initialization.

== Constraints

The following base constraints make sense for CDP-based rendering.

* We should spawn a long-running browser process
  that can be re-used between render invocations.
* The dependency on the CDP library should be optional.
  This will keep the dependency footprint small
  for users of client-side rendering and Mermaid CLI-based rendering.

The dependency constraint means that
the root goldmark/mermaid package should not import the CDP library directly.
The functionality should be implemented in an independent sub-package
that exports a type satisfying an interface defined in the outer package.

== Design

`ServerRenderer` will provide the injection point
where the CLI-based and CDP-based renderers will be plugged in.

The following interface will be defined for that purpose.

----
type CompileRequest struct {
  Source string
}

type CompileRequest struct {
  SVG string
}

type Compiler interface {
  Compile(context.Context, *CompileRequest) (*CompileResponse, error)
}
----

Two implementations will be provided:

* a CLI-based version in the root mermaid package
* a CDP-based version in a `mermaidcdp` sub-package

----
// go.abhg.dev/goldmark/mermaid
type CLICompiler struct{ /* ... */ }

func (*CLICompiler) Compile(context.Context, *CompileRequest) (*CompileResponse, error)

// go.abhg.dev/goldmark/mermaid/mermaidcdp
type Compiler struct{ /* ... */ }

func (*Compiler) Compile(context.Context, *CompileRequest) (*CompileResponse, error)
----

These will plug into the `ServerRenderer` type under a new `Compiler` field.
This field will replace
the existing `MMDC` and `Theme` fields of `ServerRenderer`.

[,diff]
----
 type ServerRenderer struct {
-  MMDC     MMDC
-  Theme    string
+  Compiler Compiler
   // ...
 }
----

For convenience, if the `ServerRenderer` was chosen
and a `Compiler` was not provided, the CLI-based compiler will be used.

=== CLI-based rendering

The `CLICompiler` will borrow fields that were previously on `ServerRenderer`:
`MMDC` and `Theme`.

For clarity, the `MMDC` field and type will be renamed to `CLI` --
making its association with the CLI-based compiler explicit.
We can also take this opportunity to use `CommandContext` on the interface,
instead of plain `Command`.

----
type CLI interface {
  CommandContext(context.Context, args ...string) *exec.Cmd
}

type CLICompiler struct {
  CLI   CLI
  Theme string
}
----

The name `CLI` was previously taken by the default implementation of `MMDC`.
This will be made private to make room for the new `CLI` type,
and the name `MMDC` will be re-used for a constructor function.

[,diff]
----
-type CLI struct{ /* ... */ }
+type mmdcCLI struct{ /* ... */ }

+func MMDC(path string) CLI
----

In short,

[cols="1a,1a,3a"]
|====
| Before | After | Purpose

| `MMDC` | `CLI` | Interface to build an `exec.Cmd` to run the Mermaid CLI
| `CLI` | `mmdcCLI` | Default implementation of the interface
| n/a   | `MMDC` | Constructor function for the default implementation
|====

=== CDP-based rendering

The CDP-based renderer will be implemented in a new `mermaidcdp` package
that will export a `Compiler` struct.
This will be built with a `New` function that accepts a `Config` struct.

----
package mermaidcdp

type Compiler struct {
  // ...
}

var _ mermaid.Compiler = (*Compiler)(nil)

func New(*Config) (*Compiler, error)
----

It'll have a `Close` method that will clean up the browser process.
Until this is called, the `Compiler` may be re-used across render invocations.

----
func (*Compiler) Close() error
----

The `Compiler` needs the following inputs:

* a copy of the MermaidJS source code to evaluate in the browser
* the theme to use for rendering (for `mermaid.initialize`)

Therefore, the `Config` struct will look as follows.

----
type Config struct {
  JSSource string
  Theme    string
}
----

=== MermaidJS source code

As mentioned previously, the CDP-based renderer
needs a copy of the MermaidJS source code.
The recommended approach will be for users to download it
and embed it into their program with `go:embed`.

As a convenience, we'll provide a function to download it on demand from a CDN.

----
package mermaidcdp

func DownloadJSSource(..., version string) (string, error)
----

=== Extender

The `mermaid.Extender` is intended to be the most convenient way
of installing this functionality into a `goldmark.Mermaid`.
Therefore, its `CLI` (n√©e `MMDC`) and `Theme` fields will be retained --
unlike `ServerRenderer` type.

A new `Compiler` field will be added to the `Extender` type
to allow users to plug in the CDP-based compiler.

[,diff]
----
 type Extender struct {
-  MMDC     MMDC
+  CLI      CLI
   Theme    string
+  Compiler Compiler
    // ...
  }
----

== Example

Putting it all together, example usage will look as follows.

.Using the CLI compiler
----
&mermaid.Extender{
  Compiler: &mermaid.CLICompiler{
    Theme: "default",
  },
}
----

.Using the CDP compiler
----
//go:embed mermaid.min.js
var mermaidJS string

comp, err := mermaidcdp.New(&mermaidcdp.Config{
  MermaidJS: mermaidJS,
  Theme:     "default",
})
if err != nil {
  // ...
}
defer comp.Close()

&mermaid.Extender{
  Compiler: comp,
}
----
